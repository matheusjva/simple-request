# Simple Request

> This repository exemplifies how we can make simple requests using Fetch and Xhr.

### What does this code do?

The code in this repository use the [Advices API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) to explain the requests. 
We use two ways to make the requests:  
- Fetch
- XHR

In the example created, we can either make the requests via fetch or xhr. We have also added the possibility to use a parameter to be passed to the API.
